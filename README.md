This repo is directly copied and modified from Ultralytics. 

The purpose is to allow for training 1 channel image instead of 3, and reduce FLOPs and parameters coming from the Detector head of Yolo. 

Modified files are task.py, head.py, block.py, conv.pv, and other files. 


These are purely experimental works.
